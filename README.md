Android application using TDD Tools and Continuous Integration

This is a sample repository to demonstrate the integration of the following tools:

- Automation:             Gradle
- Testing:                Android Testing Framework (JUnit, Instrumentation)
- Continuous Integration: TravisCI

The tests run on TravisCI.

You can inspect the '.travis.yml' script to see how this works.

To run the tests locally on your machine, you have to use Gradle.
